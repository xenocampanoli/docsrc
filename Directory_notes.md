# Notes regarding the docsrc *app*:

## Maintenance Objectives

Fixes and Additions to docsrc should accommodate all existing tests,
possibly adding new if that is a responsible step, and complying with
go fmt, or equivalent.

Tests in packages use the native test system as per recommendations.
Tests I write on docsrc.go use a bash script.  My rationale with
tests is they should not only help prevent maintenance problems, but
can also serve well as a learning tool, so for something that
executes from the shell, I want to test from the shell.

## Acknowledgements:

Many people in IRC, mostly in the #go-nuts group, helped me learn Go.  I could not have gotten as far as I have in the time
available to me without this help.  As such, it is certainly my secular karma, as it were, to aid others correspondingly,
and I will try to do so, especially if concerned with the specifics of this application / exercise.

And no, despite all this, I really don't know Python very well.  I do know Ruby, Bash, C, and now I know Golang, at least
a little.
